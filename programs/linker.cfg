# Simple linker config: load program code starting at $8000
#
# MEMORY section defines the conceptual memory layout:
#   - 'start' is the address where the code will live in the CPU's memory.
#     Labels in your assembly (e.g., 'main') are resolved relative to this.
#   - 'size' is the maximum amount of space allocated to this region.
#     The linker checks that your code does not exceed this space.
#
# IMPORTANT: These addresses do NOT appear in the raw .bin file.
# The .bin is just a contiguous sequence of bytes. The loader (or emulator)
# must place them at the intended memory address (here $8000) for the CPU
# to execute correctly.

MEMORY {
    ROM: start = $8000, size = $8000, type = ro;
